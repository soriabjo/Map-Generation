## Map 4: Ukraine Theme

Map centered on the city of Seattle. As my group's research proposal is focused on Ukraine, I designed a custom map style in Mapbox using Ukraine's flag official color codes. The theme contains the firestation locations in Seattle as well. Zoom levels were minimum of 1, maximum of 14
